How does precipitation affects air quality in terms of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5)?

I selected data from 3 different air quality monitoring stations in Bogota, Colombia from the official network to see if precipitation decreases pollution in the air during 2017 to 2019 due to washing effect.

In the three stations we could not easily see a direct correlation between precipitation and PM 2.5, however we can see that precipitation not necessarily decreases pollution. We can see high levels of PM2.5 even when there is high levels of precipitation, in fact we see that in station 3 there is a slightly tendence to the right which suggest an increase in pollution, this could be related to aersols formed in the air.  

In conclusion we could see that precipitation does not reduces pollution in the air and potentially increases. More variables need to be take into account.
